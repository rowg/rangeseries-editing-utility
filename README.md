# rangeseries-editing-utility
A utility to help edit rangeseries files, based on timeseries-editing-utility.
See timeseries-editing-utility for a description.
The main difference is that the text file contains IQ data with both samples on one line, rather than on sequential lines. Also, the IQ data values are preceded by an index counter that might be useful for plotting and is ignored when reading text files in rsgen mode.
